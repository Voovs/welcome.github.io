    <h2 class="title subheader">What this site is:</h2>
    <p>You should probably be on acumensyndicate.ca to see this<br>
      message. This is our, Acumen syndicate's, first website!<br>
      We're pretty excited about it! Feel free to come back in<br>
      a month or so to see our first real project. Expected time<br>
      for project "Hydrogen", our first one, to come out is about<br>
      mid to late February 2018, so stay tuned! Any changes to the<br>
      release schedual will be updated on this site</p>
    <h2 class="title">Who is Acumen syndicate?</h2>
    <p>Acumen syndicate is our sort of fake company name, as we aren't<br>
      registed. We're just a group of friends who's interested in trying<br>
      out some website development. Acumen is based in Canada, hence<br> 
      the ".ca" domain name. Well, that and there was a discount, on<br>
      Godaddy, that made ".ca" domains priced at a cheap $1. That's<br>
      even cheaper than you think, since it's in CAD not USD. Anyways,<br>
      our secondary goal, other than learning, is reforming a certain<br>
      site that we believe is undermineing its true potential<p>
    <h4 class="subheader">Interested in having a go at some HTML yourself?</h4>
    <p>No problem.<br>
      All you need is a computer, running any OS with broser support<br>
      and internet connection. To learn HTML/CSS/JS, we use MDN's<br>
      learning section. It's free and generally great! We highly<br>
      suggest using it</p>
